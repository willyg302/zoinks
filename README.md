# SCUBA

SCUBA Dive Planner Project for ICS 414

## Disclaimer

This system is a **prototype** and should NOT be used to plan real dives!

## Quick Start

1. Install [strap](https://github.com/willyg302/strap.py)

2. Grab SCUBA, build it, and start the development server

   ```bash
   strap init gh:willyg302/SCUBA
   cd SCUBA
   strap run build
   strap
   ```

You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your favorite browser to see the SCUBA Dive Planner.
